SmugMug Promise Events Mixin
============================

Adds an `on()` method to a promise to allow for non-resolution related event
notifications such as cancelation or progress. Additionally, the promise's
`then` method is "infected" to propagate the mixin to its returned promises as
well, allowing notifications to cascade throughout a promise chain.

Usage
-----

Create a `Y.Promise.EventNotifier` instance. Create a Promise and pass it to the
instance's `addEvents` method. The Promise is now decorated with an
`on(type, callback)` method and its `then` method will return promises
similarly decorated and linked to your `Y.Promise.EventNotifier` instance.

```js
YUI({
    gallery: 'gallery-2013.03.27-22-06'
}).use('node', 'gallery-sm-promise-events', function (Y) {
    var notifier = new Y.Promise.EventNotifier(),
        promise, chainedPromise, interval, cancel;

    // Wire up a button to cancel the promise transaction
    cancel = Y.once('#cancel').on('click', function () {
        clearInterval(interval);

        this.set('disabled', true);

        notifier.fire('cancel');
    });

    // Create a promise that will resolve in 10 seconds unless canceled by the
    // button click. The promise transaction also notifies of its progress
    // every second.
    promise = new Y.Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        var complete = 0;

        // notify subscribers of progress every second until it is done
        interval = setInterval(function () {
            complete += 10;

            notifier.fire('progress', { percent: complete });

            if (complete >= 100) {
                cancel.detach();

                resolve();
            }
        }, 1000);
    });

    // decorate the promise with an on() method and register with notifier
    notifier.addEvents(promise);

    promise.on('progress', function (e) {
        // e.type === 'progress'
        Y.one('#progress-indicator').setStyle('width', e.percent + '%');
    });

    // chained promises are automatically registered and decorated with on()
    chainedPromise = promise.then(function () {
        Y.one('#message').setHTML('All done!').show();
    });

    chainedPromise.on('cancel', function (e) {
        Y.one('#message').setHTML('Canceled!').show();
        Y.one('#progress-indicator').hide();
    });
}
```
