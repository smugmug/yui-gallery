SmugMug TreeView History
========================

## git

* Added a `force` option to `Y.TreeView#renderChildren()` and
  `Y.TreeView#renderNode()`. Set it to `true` to force re-rendering from scratch
  even if things have already been rendered.

* Fixed: When re-rendering the children of an already-rendered node, DOM nodes
  were removed and re-appended to the container unnecessarily. They're now
  simply updated in place.

* Fixed: The `aria-labelledby` HTML attribute was misspelled as
  `aria-labelled-by`. [[@skylargivens][#34]]

## 2013-06-20

* Nodes are no longer automatically focused when selected in single-select mode.

* When the last child is removed from a parent node, the parent node's child
  list element is now removed from the DOM.

* The `gallery-sm-treeview-templates` module has been merged into
  `gallery-sm-treeview`, since it had no benefit as a standalone module.

* Added the `gallery-sm-treeview-sortable` module, which provides
  `Y.TreeView.Sortable`, a `Y.TreeView` extension that wraps `Y.Tree.Sortable`
  and re-renders TreeView nodes when they're re-sorted.

* Fixed: Clicks and double-clicks no longer trigger actions when a button other
  than the primary button is used (generally the left button on a mouse).

* Fixed: Adding lots of children to a parent node that had already been
  rendered resulted in the parent being re-rendered once for each added child.
  Parent re-render operations are now batched asynchronously, so a parent won't
  be re-rendered more than once every 15ms regardless of how many children are
  added.

## 2013-03-27

* `Y.TreeView` now mixes in `Y.Tree.Labelable`, which it should have been doing
  already. Oops.

## 2013-03-20

* Now using `Y.Tree` from YUI core, which means TreeView requires YUI 3.9.0+.

* TreeView templates can now be more easilly overridden by passing a
  `config.templates` object to the constructor. Read the source for spicy
  details.

## 2013-02-27

* Fixed: `clear()` didn't re-render the tree after clearing it.

## 2013-01-09

* TreeView now mixes in the new `Tree.Openable` extension.

* Fixed: Re-rendering a node with an undefined `canHaveChildren` property
  resulted in the "canHaveChildren" classname being applied when it shouldn't
  have been.

* Fixed: Parent node's DOM state wasn't updated correctly when a child was added
  or removed after the parent was rendered.

## 2012-12-26

* Initial gallery release.
